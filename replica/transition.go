// are not ready to be processed because of the `State`. All
// `Transitions` are buffered against their respective `Height` and
// will be dequeued one by one.
// Note: TransitionBuffer is not thread safe
//
// There are two types of Transitions, those with a `Height` and those
// that are "immediate". Any "immediate" Transitions will be
// `Dequeue`ed first, regardless of the provided `Height`. Otherwise,
// `Dequeue` will return the most relevant `Transition` for the given
// `Height`. For example: you will not get a `PreVoted` if a
// `PreCommitted` was already `Enqueue`ed at that `Height`.
//
// Keep in mind Transitions that don't have a `Height` are not pruned.
// For example: if you `Enqueue` a `TimedOut` twice then the next two
// `Dequeue` will return a `TimedOut`. The "immediate" `Transition`s are
// stored in a FIFO queue.
